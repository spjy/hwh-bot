            + '**B) Remain civil**  — Maintain civil conversations by displaying a placid demeanor. Don\'t spew derogatory terms or threaten others. Avoid over-excessive profanity.\n\n'
            + '**C) Discord name / nickname**  — Your name must precede with a minimum of three QWERTY keyboard characters, remain within the bounds of the message line, and maintain an appropriate appearance.\n\n'
            + '**D) Use the `@Staff` mention for reports only.** — In the report, please also include the offender and the offense. Do not submit false or trolly reports.\n\n'
            + '**E) Don\'t backseat moderate** — Let staff members give the punishments. If you notice a rule breaker, submit a report (reference the previous point (1D)).\n\n'
            + '**F) Age requirement** — Though you should be aware of Discord\'s age requirement, we reiterate that you must be at least thirteen (13) years old to use Discord and to be in this server. No exceptions.\n\u200b'

            + '**C) Advertising servers, services, or social media without permission** — We want to be sure to scan them for any inappropriate content before posting them. Don\'t send any of the above content without permission from staff.\n\n'
            + '**D) Offering payment, goods, or services in exchange for having your work done.** — We don\'t want to be held liable for any transactions that occur on this server. Don\'t offer any of the above in exchange for having your work done.\n\n'
            + '**E) Unsolicited direct messages** — As a courtesy to respect others\' privacy, don\'t send direct messages asking for help unless explicitly given permission.\n\n'
            + '**F) Bypassing paywalled accounts** — Do not ask other users to share accounts or violate paywalls for services such as Chegg or Course Hero. \n\u200b'

            + '**B) Cheating** — Academic integrity is an ideology we uphold seriously, so do not attempt to encourage cheating. Do not give answers; instead, guide the person through the problem to gain intuition on how to solve it.\n\n'
            + '**C) Only post one instance of your question** — (ex. if you post your question in #math, you cannot post it in any other channel). This is to avoid double helping.\n\n'
            + '**D) Mentioning** — If you use a help mention, you must include the majority of the question in the ping message.\n\u200b'
